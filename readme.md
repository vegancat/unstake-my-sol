## How it works
NFT collection can create a liquidity account for themselves and setup their desired commission for their liquidity similar to royalty in NFTs.

Users would swap their current stake account for the SOL provided and pay the commission to the NFT collection.

## This a win-win-win solution
1. NFT collection gets their commission
2. Users get their SOL instantly
3. Projects keep their treasury in native SOL and it boosts the morale in NFT community and also helps with the price of SOL
